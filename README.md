In this project our helicopter/ball/plane learns how to avoid objects on its own, simply by playing and losing as many times as needed.
It was designed for Computational Intelligence course. <br> <br>
A simple 2D minigame is also implemented. <br>
The agent needs to learn to maneuver via neural network + evolution.


## Game Modes
Helicopter             |  Gravity          |  Thrust
